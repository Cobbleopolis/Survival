            <p>Feeling lost? Are you in a rut? Maybe you feel like you are just another face is the crowd? Want to
                stand out? Better yourself? Well, <a href="http://transcendentalism-legacy.tamu.edu/ideas/">Transcendentalism</a>
                may be able to help. We provide a one-month survival retreat where you detach from society, no
                electronics, no communication with society, live off the
                land and better your mind. With the teachings of Transcendentalism, this journey can help guide you to
                Self-actualization and self-reliance. It causes you to provide all the necessities of life for yourself
                allowing you to stop relying on other people and entities. This retreat also lets you get away from
                all the stresses of life and the materialistic world and simply allows you to be one with the world and
                nature.</p>
            <br>

            <p>During this journey, you will break away from society. Secede from its tyrannous rule over its
                individual, become your own person. No longer conform to their standards or rules. Become a true
                individual. Find your own path, discover your true purpose. Realize how society is only taking away your
                individuality and liberty.The isolation allows you to redefine yourself without influence from any person
                or entity.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Helpful tips to make your journey more enjoyable is that you may want to bring a journal with you to
                keep track of the days and document your journey. another do not always take the same path when going
                to or from places or change the order of what you do each day, nothing will change, and, therefore, no
                progress will be made if you do the same things over and over again. </p>

            <p class="desc">The recommended location for this type of retreat is Cook Island, Maine or some similar
                site. A map of the island can be found below as well as some other information about the location such
                as natural resources and average weather. Also there is a list of supplies below, this is only a
                suggested list and items can be added or removed as needed although a hard $500 limit must be set to
                prevent you from carrying too many materialistic items with you.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Although removing oneself from society for a large period of time is not easy it can be done. You do have
                to plan for your eventual return to society, like communicating to your employer that do intend to
                eventually, return to work. Also, inform your family that you will embark on this trip and will not be
                able to be contacted during this time.</p>
